<h1>About Groopy</h1>
<p>This application exists because I am a user of the Flickr <a href="https://www.flickr.com/groups/views25/" target="_blank">Views: 25...25000</a> groups.</p>
<p>The idea of these groups is that as soon as your photos have over a certain number of views they are
eligible to be added to the group. However the rules say that a photo can be a member one view group
at a time. </p>
<p>I found the process of searching for photos and manually moving them between groups quite laborious.</p>
<p>So I created an application in 2008 called Groopy.  <br/>This is the 2016 version <i class="fa fa-smile-o"></i></p>
<p>If you like the app or want to comment then please send me a <a href="http://www.flickr.com/messages_write.gne?to=32563803@N00" target="_blank">Flickr mail</a>.</p>
